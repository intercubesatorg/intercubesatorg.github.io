                            Travis Imken received an M.S. in Aerospace Engineering from The University of Texas at Austin in 2014. His research focused on the development of the 3D-printed cold-gas attitude control system for the JPL INSPIRE CubeSatellites. While at UT Austin, Travis worked in the Texas Spacecraft Laboratory and supported many small satellite missions in various leadership roles, including the Bevo-1 picosatellite and the Bevo-2, ARMADILLO, and RACE CubeSats. He currently works as a Systems Engineer in the Advanced Design Engineering Group at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Travis serves as a systems engineer and model developer for the Team Xc concurrent design team. He also works as a systems engineer for the proposed interplanetary Lunar Flashlight and NEA Scout CubeSat missions. Travis is an avid skier and enjoys the outdoors.

                            Dr. Christopher Kitts is an Associate Professor at Santa Clara University where he serves as the Director of the Robotic Systems Laboratory (RSL) and as Associate Dean of Research and Faculty Development within the School of Engineering.  Over the past decade, Dr. Kitts has been the Mission Operations Director for a series of NASA small spacecraft, which are controlled on-orbit by RSL students using SCU's own distributed, internet-based command and control network.  Through RSL, Dr. Kitts and his students also develop systems for conducting field missions with unmanned aircraft, terrestrial rovers, and marine robots.  Prior to joining SCU, Dr. Kitts worked as a spacecraft autonomy engineer at NASA Ames Research Center, served in the U.S. Air Force as a mission controller for a constellation of Department of Defense spacecraft, and was a founder and the Graduate Student Director of Stanford's Space Systems Development Laboratory.  Dr. Kitts is a Fellow of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers and holds a concurrent research appointment at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute.  Dr. Kitts is a graduate of Stanford University, the University of Colorado, and Princeton University.
