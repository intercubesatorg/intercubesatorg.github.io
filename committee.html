                            Alex Austin received a bachelor’s degree in aeronautical and mechanical engineering and a master’s degree in aeronautical engineering from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) in 2016. His research focused on the optimization of multicopter rotor designs using computational fluid dynamics. While at RPI, Alex also worked on a CubeSat project to design a system capable of capturing and deorbiting a small piece of space debris. He currently works as a Systems Engineer in the Advanced Design Engineering Group at NASA JPL, where he supports a number of early formulation projects and mission proposals. Alex also works closely with the JPL concurrent engineering design teams (A-Team, Team X, and Team Xc) to rapidly create and evaluate new mission concepts.

Pamela Clark, of the Advanced Instrument Concepts and Science Applications Group in the Instrument Division, at Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, is Technical Advisor of the JPL Cubesat Development Lab. She is also Science PI of the NASA EM1 Lunar IceCube Mission, as well as Convener and Program Chair for the Annual LunarCubes Workshops, and an adjunct research professor at Catholic University of America. She holds a PhD in Geochemical Remote Sensing from University of Maryland. Her interests include extending the cubesat paradigm to deep space technology demonstrations and science requirements driven cubesat missions, developing compact science instruments, evolving a low-cost development model for deep space missions, and using the cubesat paradigm to set up distributed networks for studying whole system dynamics.  She is the author of several books, including Remote Sensing Tools for Exploration, Constant-Scale Natural Boundary Mapping to Reveal Global and Cosmic Processes, and Dynamic Planet: Mercury in the Context of its Environment.
